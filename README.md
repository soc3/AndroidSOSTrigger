By this an additional feature has been added to the app :
On triggering of the SOS button or the separate buttons for send photo and message
A photo will be clicked and sent (after 5 sec period if one want) automatically by the front camera without opening and without any flash
So, without giving any clue to the criminal or to anyone near which can prove to be a very good security measure.

Permissions for the same has been added in the manifest file.
